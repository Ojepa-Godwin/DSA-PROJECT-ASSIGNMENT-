**The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues 
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently 
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This 
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the 
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, 
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues**
*Using the case scenarios, I answerd all the case scenarios nd presented the in visual forms like, barchart, kpi, donut chat, pie chart:

#1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments

 #2.Show insights on ratings based on gender
 
#3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus ofmanagement

*4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing* companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000 
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
** From the case study, i deduced that Palmoria does not meet the requirement because she pays her employees lower than 90,000
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
 many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
**● Also visualize this by regions**

5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee 
data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the 
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus 
payments and asked you to: 

#●  Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees

●  Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of 
bonus) 
 Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
